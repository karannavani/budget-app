## Overview

Your instructors will partner you with other classmates to design and collaboratively build a MEAN stack app of your own design.

- **M**ongo - For the database
- **E**xpress - For the web-framework
- **A**ngular - Angular(1) for the client-side framework
- **N**ode - For the server-side language

This is the _most realistic_ stack that you have worked on during the course and will prepare you for working in the industry where the MEAN stack setup is still very popular.

**This is meant to push you both technically and collaboratively.** It is a lot harder to work in a team than to work by yourself. However, it is very likely thank you are going to find yourself working in a teams throughout your development careers so **it's important to learn how to work together.**

Make it work, and make it awesome.

## Technical Requirements

* **Carefully plan wireframes** as a team _before starting to code_
* **Carefully plan Model schemas*** as a team _before starting to code_
* **Manage team contributions and collaboration** using a Git on Github
* **Deploy your application online** so it's publicly accessible

### Server-side

Your app must:

* **Use Mongo, Node & Express** to build a server-side API
* **Your API must have at least 2 related models**, one of which should be a user
* Your API should include **all RESTFUL actions** for at least one of those models
* Include **authentication** to restrict access to appropriate users
* **Include at least one referenced or embedded sub-document**, however don't go crazy! You need to manage your time effectively...
* **Include automated tests** for at least one resource

### Client-side

* **Use Angular** to build a front-end that consumes your API
* **Use SCSS instead of CSS**
* **Use Webpack & Yarn** to manage your dependencies and compile your source code

---

## Necessary Deliverables

* A **working API, built by the whole team**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A handmade Angular front-end **that consumes your own API**, hosted somewhere on the internet
* A **link to your hosted working app** in the URL section of your Github repo
* A **team git repository hosted on Github**, with a link to your hosted project, and frequent commits from _every_ team member dating back to the _very beginning_ of the project
* **A `readme.md` file** with:
	* Explanations of the **technologies** used
   	* A couple of paragraphs about the **general approach you took**
   	* **Installation instructions** for any dependencies
   	* Link to your **wireframes** – sketches of major views / interfaces in your application
   * Descriptions of any **unsolved problems** or **major hurdles** your team had to overcome

## Suggested Ways to Get Started

* **Don’t hesitate to write throwaway code** to solve short term problems.
* **Read the docs for whatever technologies / frameworks / API’s you use**.
* **Write your code DRY** and **build your APIs RESTful**.
* **Be consistent with your code style.** You're working in teams, but you're only making one app per team. Make sure it looks like a unified effort.
* **Commit early, commit often.** Don’t be afraid to break something because you can always go back in time to a previous version.
* **Keep user stories small and well-defined**, and remember – user stories focus on what a user needs, not what development tasks need accomplishing.
* **Write code another developer wouldn't have to ask you about**. Do your naming conventions make sense? Would another developer be able to look at your app and understand what everything is?
* **Make it all well-formatted.** Are you indenting, consistently? Can we find the start and end of every div, curly brace, etc?
* **Comment your code.** Will someone understand what is going on in each block or function? Even if it's obvious, explaining the what & why means someone else can pick it up and get it.
* **Write pseudocode before you write actual code.** Thinking through the logic of something helps.
